# Report-System
Report System for Sourcemod games.

Admin comands:

- !reportes -> Show a menu with all the reports. When the admin select a report he can get it or he can delete it. Once an admin is on a report nobody can touch that report.

Player comands:

- !reportar -> Open a menu with the player list, when the player select an user he will see another menu with the reasons to report wim. When selected the reason sends the report to the admins.
- !reportar <name> <reason> -> Sends the report to the admins.
  
  More improvements soon.
